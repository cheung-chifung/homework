Program sample files for the MAX-kLIN problems for the advanced algorithm course.

Created by Osamu Watanabe
Last Update: 2012.6.15

Contents:

  sample2.c           generator of example MAX-2LIN instances
  sample2mpass.gp.c   message passing algorithm
  sample2gwalk.c      simple greedy + random walk (for MAX-2LIN)
  sample3gwalk.c      simple greedy + random walk (for MAX-3LIN)

Remark:

 Here "simple greedy + random walk" is a variation of the
 greedy heuristics explained in the lecture.
