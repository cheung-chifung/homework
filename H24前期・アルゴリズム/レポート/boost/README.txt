Mushroom Database

From http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/
Originally from the UCI repository of machine learning databases.

The following modifications have been made by O.W:

1. Removal of attr. #11 (and shifted the others)
   since some data item has ? value at this attribute.
2. Permute the data items randomly.

Files:

  dataspec.txt : explanation on this data
  dataatr.txt  : list of attribute values
  data.txt     : data set

  mt.h   : header file for the pseudo number generator MT19937
  stat.c : sample program
